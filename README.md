Rust implementation of <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/wheeler"> zxcvbn </a> based on the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity16/sec16_paper_wheeler.pdf"> paper </a> from DropBox Inc.

# An App and an API as well
In the releases tab you will find the current version of the calculator if you wanna check your  password strength offline (as you should). But the project will also provide an API to enable seamless integration into your projects with custom dictionaries support.

# Development
This will be actively maintained since is one of the dependencies for the Rust based password manager Safe.
